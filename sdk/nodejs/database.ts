/**
 * The ``postgresql.Database`` resource creates and manages [database
 * objects](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/static/managing-databases.html)
 * within a PostgreSQL server instance.
 *
 * ## Usage
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as postgresql from "@pulumi/postgresql";
 *
 * const myDb = new postgresql.Database("my_db", {
 *     name: "my_db",
 *     owner: "my_role",
 *     template: "template0",
 *     lcCollate: "C",
 *     connectionLimit: -1,
 *     allowConnections: true,
 *     alterObjectOwnership: true,
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * ## Import Example
 *
 * `postgresql.Database` supports importing resources.  Supposing the following
 * Terraform:
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as postgresql from "@pulumi/postgresql";
 *
 * const db1 = new postgresql.Database("db1", {name: "testdb1"});
 * ```
 *
 * It is possible to import a `postgresql.Database` resource with the following
 * command:
 *
 * Where `testdb1` is the name of the database to import and
 * `postgresql_database.db1` is the name of the resource whose state will be
 * populated as a result of the command.
