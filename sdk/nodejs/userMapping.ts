/**
 * The ``postgresql.UserMapping`` resource creates and manages a user mapping on a PostgreSQL server.
 *
 * ## Usage
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as postgresql from "@pulumi/postgresql";
 *
 * const extPostgresFdw = new postgresql.Extension("ext_postgres_fdw", {name: "postgres_fdw"});
 * const myserverPostgres = new postgresql.Server("myserver_postgres", {
 *     serverName: "myserver_postgres",
 *     fdwName: "postgres_fdw",
 *     options: {
 *         host: "foo",
 *         dbname: "foodb",
 *         port: "5432",
 *     },
 * }, {
 *     dependsOn: [extPostgresFdw],
 * });
 * const remote = new postgresql.Role("remote", {name: "remote"});
 * const remoteUserMapping = new postgresql.UserMapping("remote", {
 *     serverName: myserverPostgres.serverName,
 *     userName: remote.name,
 *     options: {
 *         user: "admin",
 *         password: "pass",
 *     },
 * });
 * ```
