    /// The ``postgresql.Database`` resource creates and manages [database

    /// within a PostgreSQL server instance.
    /// 
    /// ## Usage
    /// 
    /// ```csharp
    /// using System.Collections.Generic;
    /// using System.Linq;
    /// using Pulumi;
    /// using PostgreSql = Pulumi.PostgreSql;
    /// 
    /// return await Deployment.RunAsync(() =&gt; 
    /// {
    ///     var myDb = new PostgreSql.Database("my_db", new()

    ///     var db1 = new PostgreSql.Database("db1", new()
    ///     {
    ///         Name = "testdb1",
    ///     });
